This text file contains inforamtion which needs to be updated in order to change the color schema

This repo has _vars.scss file which has the color palate for the whole website. Just changing the accent color over there would work. 
For example "#3c3b3b" is the color for the bold letters. If we change that the whole file will change by Itself.

Find that file over, src/static/css/libs/_vars.scss
