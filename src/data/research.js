      'A prototype of a multi-user system for access control to data sets stored in a malicious cloud environment is presented. '
      + 'Cloud storage like any other environment needs the ability to securely shared information. '
      + 'The approach here is to provide access control over the data stored in the cloud without provider participation. '
      + 'The main tool of the access control mechanism is a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme with dynamic attributes and advanced encryption algorithms. '
      + 'Using a based decentralized ledger, our system provides an immutable log of all meaningful security events, such as key generation, access policy assignments, changes or revocations, and access requests. '
      + 'We propose a set of protocols to ensure the privacy of operations requiring secret or private keys. '
      + 'Only hash codes are transferred through the ledger.'
      + 'The prototype of the system is implemented using smart contracts and tested on the platform.',
